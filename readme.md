# About The Project

[Predicting Druggable Proteins from Primary Sequence (amino acid sequence)](https://github.com/Sharma-PS/Predicting-druggable-proteins)

Druggable proteins are those that can interact with drug-like molecules and are used as targets for drugs 
that can potentially be effective in treating disease. Predicting the druggability of proteins is therefore a 
crucial step in the development of new drugs. Computational models that can predict the druggability of 
proteins using only their primary sequence is a time and cost-effective complement to the more precise 
yet more time consuming and laborious experimental methods that analyze the tertiary (3D) structure of 
proteins. In this assignment, you will explore the use of machine learning methods for predicting the 
durability of proteins from their primary amino acid sequence.
